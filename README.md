**Year:** 2025

## Project Overview

**FitForge** is a mobile fitness application that uses **machine learning** to deliver **truly personalized** diet and workout plans that adapt in real-time to the user's progress, body feedback, and changing goals.

Many existing fitness apps offer static plans that lead to plateaus, loss of motivation, and poor long-term results. FitForge solves this problem with **holistic**, AI-driven adaptation of both nutrition and training programs.

## Problem Statement

Most current fitness applications provide:
- Static workout/diet templates
- Very limited real-time adaptation
- Fragmented approach (either nutrition OR training, rarely both well)

**Consequences:**
- Users frequently reach plateaus
- High abandonment rates
- Loss of motivation
- Suboptimal results

**Key market gap identified:**  
Lack of applications that offer **deep integration** of nutrition + training with **continuous machine-learning-based personalization**.

## Core Concept & Goals

### Main Objective

- Beginners looking for proper guidance
- Personal trainers & nutrition coaches (client management)
- Tech-savvy users who value device integration & data-driven approach

## Key Features (MVP – Minimum Viable Product)

1. User registration & detailed profile setup
2. AI-powered personalization engine  
   → Continuous plan adaptation based on progress
3. Holistic diet + workout recommendations
4. Progress tracking & beautiful visualizations
